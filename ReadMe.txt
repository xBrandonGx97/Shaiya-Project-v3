Thank you for choosing to download my first Shaiya CMS/ACP !
First, make sure you run all of the required database scripts.
Once you done that, make sure to configure your database information in /assets/classes/Database.class.php and DB_Info.class.php

after that, some scripts may require you to edit them because in some of the scripts it is selected certain columns,
some columns which may not exist for you since I use quite a few of custom columns.
Shouldn't be too hard, just open the script up in a text editor and remove/add the columns which exist for you:
one example of a script is:
assets/content/acp/account/account_edit.php

I apologize for this, I could change this but then I would have to constantly change it just to work on it.

Also be sure to check the instructions in the Installation folder.

Thank you, [Dev]Velocity
